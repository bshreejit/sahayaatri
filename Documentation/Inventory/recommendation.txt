Recomenmendation can be done using Colarabitive filtering(CF) methods.In CF methods, the recommendation process is based on ratings of “similiar” users, that is, users who have similar
preferences. The CF methods are classified into two categories [8]: memory-based (or user-based collaborative
filtering – UBCF) methods and model-based (or item-based collaborative filtering – IBCF). Memory-based type of
algorithms are also known as the nearest neighbors method, being the first technique to be employed in this category.
When computing the recommendation, the whole set of user ratings is processed because the opinions of the current
user are compared with the ones of all the other users in order to find the neighbors (users with the most similar
opinions). Model-based techniques use a different strategy, mainly to minimize some weaknesses (see text below) of
the memory-based methods. Model-based methods use data mining techniques to develop a model of user ratings,
which is used to predict user preferences.
